Unfortunately, as a citizen of the Russian Federation, 
I have been sanctioned by the United States, and 
I cannot operate my JetBrains license in the territory of the Russian Federation.

I am forced to use JetBrains products in a roundabout way. 
One of them is the repeated trial period. 
This repository contains a script that resets the trial period to all installed JetBrains products on Windows 10.

I want this script to be used by other people who have been sanctioned by the United States.
